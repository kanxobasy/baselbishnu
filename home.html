                <span>                <p>
                    I am Bishnu Prasad Basel, a diligent and adaptable professional hailing from Devchuli
                    Municipality -07, Nawalparasi East District, Nepal. With a Bachelor's degree in Business Studies
                    from Jana Jyoti Aadarsha Multiple College, along with a strong foundation in commerce from Shree
                    Bhimsen Adarsha Higher Secondary School, I have honed my skills and expertise to excel in the
                    professional arena.

                    My journey in the corporate world has been enriched with diverse experiences across various
                    sectors. As a Travel Consultant at Buddha Travel & Tours, I have facilitated seamless travel
                    experiences for clients, leveraging my knack for customer service and travel solutions. Prior to
                    this, my tenure as an Office Assistant at Gevora Hotel LLC in Dubai exposed me to the
                    intricacies of hospitality management, where I ensured utmost guest satisfaction through
                    efficient administrative support.

                    My foray into the financial sector as an Assistant Officer and Branch Incharge at Kisan Saving &
                    Credit Cooperative Ltd. and Madhyanepal Saving & Credit Cooperative Ltd. equipped me with
                    valuable insights into financial management and cooperative operations. Through these roles, I
                    managed cash transactions, handled accounting responsibilities, and provided exemplary service
                    to members, contributing to their socio-economic upliftment.

                    Complemented by a robust educational background and industrial exposure, I possess a diverse
                    skill set ranging from cash handling and financial accounting to communication and leadership.
                    Proficient in MS Office Suite and accounting software such as Pearls Plus and Necos Plus, I am
                    adept at leveraging technology to streamline operations and enhance productivity.

                    Beyond the professional realm, I am characterized by my passion for continuous learning and
                    personal development. A quick learner with a penchant for reading, traveling, and music, I
                    thrive in dynamic environments that foster growth and innovation.

                    With a strong work ethic, excellent interpersonal skills, and a commitment to excellence, I am
                    poised to contribute effectively to any organization, driving success and fostering professional
                    growth.

            <h3 class=mydream>My Dream On future</h3>
            <p class="description"> My dream is to create a comprehensive platform that serves as a one-stop destination
                for
                people from all walks of life. This platform will revolutionize the way individuals buy and sell
                products,
                providing a seamless experience for users. Whether you're looking to purchase goods, sell your own
                products,
                or seek solutions to various needs, this platform will offer everything you require in one centralized
                location. It's more than just a marketplace; it's a hub of connectivity, convenience, and empowerment.
                By
                bringing together buyers, sellers, and solution providers, my dream platform will not only simplify
                transactions but also foster a sense of community and collaboration. With dedication and innovation, I
                aim
                to turn this dream into a reality, creating a valuable resource that enhances the lives of countless
                individuals.</p>
